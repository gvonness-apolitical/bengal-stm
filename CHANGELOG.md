## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- Multi-key map bug in `TxnLogContext` where `setVarMapValue` and `modifyVarMapValue` used the map's structure runtime ID instead of the per-key runtime ID, causing multiple set/modify operations for different keys in the same transaction to overwrite each other's log entries

### Added
- Scalafix CI enforcement with import ordering checks
- Code coverage reporting in CI
- 77 new tests (62 → 139, 2 ignored as flaky): targeted coverage for `TxnVarMap`, `TxnVar`, `waitFor`, `handleErrorWith`, `pure`/`delay`, `TxnLogEntry` types, and multi-key regression tests

### Changed
- Scala 3 bumped from 3.3.4 to 3.3.7 LTS
- ScalaCheck bumped from 1.18.1 to 1.19.0
- cats-effect-testing bumped from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0
- sbt-typelevel bumped from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5
- Refactored `TxnLogContext`: extracted `getLogEntry` helper, unified duplicate entry/value write methods (−12% lines)
